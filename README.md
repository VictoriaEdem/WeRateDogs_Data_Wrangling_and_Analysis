# WeRateDogs_Data_Wrangling_and_Analysis

## by Victoria Edem

## Project Overview
For Udacity Data Analyst project 2(Wrangle and Analyze Data), I gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I document my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, and showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).


## Introduction
The dataset in this project is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. The goal is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The twitter data however contains very basic information. Therefore,  additional gathering of data is carried out using twitter API and image prediction data before assessing and cleaning.

## Process
1. Having already installed Python and Anaconda, I use the following libraries:
   * pandas
   * NumPy
   * requests
   * json
2. Gathering Data 
3. Assessing Data
4. Cleaning Data
5. Storing Data
6. Analyzing, and visualizing data
7. Reporting on - data wrangling efforts, data analyses and visualizations.


## Insights
  * The source of most WeRateDogs account tweets are from an iPhone using the Twitter app.
  * A tweet containing the image of a Golden retriever has the most likes and retweets of all dog species posted.
  * Tweets with more retweets are likely to have a high number of likes. It is also likely that tweets made from an iPhone get more likes than others although this maybe be dependent on other factors, like content of tweet.
