# WeRateDogs_Data_Wrangling_and_Analysis

## by Victoria Edem

## Project Overview
For Udacity Data Analyst project 2(Wrangle and Analyze Data), I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. 


## Introduction
The dataset, originally from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) contains information from 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil and its 14 associated variables. The questions asked are:
  * Do women take more care of their health when compared to men?
  * How does hypertension affect the chances of a patient showing up for their appointments?
  * Is age a factor that causes patients to show up more for their appointments?
  * What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

## Process
1. Installation of Python and Anaconda, plus the following libraries:
   * pandas
   * NumPy
   * Matplotlib
2. Data Wrangling 
   * Data Assessment
   * Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Conclusions

## Conclusions
  * Women take better care of their health when compared to men.
  * Hypertension in a patient increases inclination to show up for appointments.
  * Age is a factor that causes patients to show up for their appointments. Babies and elderly patients have the most show ups to appointment.
  * Hypertension, Diabetes, Age, Month, Day of the week, Alcoholism, and Handicap are important factors to help predict if a patient will show up for their appointment.
